# Book Club API Integration with React and Node.js - Frontend + Backend
 Overview
This project focuses on creating REST API endpoints to facilitate CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations between a React front-end and a Node.js back-end.  
This is CODECADEMY tutorial.   
The application serves as a management tool for a local book club to efficiently track book titles and their reading schedules.

## Technologies  
Language: JavaScript ES6  
Front-end Framework: React  
Back-end Environment: Node   
Server Framework: Express   

## Features  
The application supports the following functionalities:  

Retrieve the initial list of books.  
Add a new book with its reading schedule.  
Update a bookâ€™s details and reading schedule.  
Delete a book from the list.  

## Setup and Installation
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the starting code.
2. Install dependencies in both the frontend and backend directories - npm install
3. Open two terminal windows - one for the frontend and one for the backend.
4. Start the backend server: npm run start

## What I did I learn?
deploy backend and frontend separately and connect them using fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}, where my endpoint was the backend url address.
Here you can find backend only for the all books https://books-app-backend-2.onrender.com/books
